# ShallowBlue - AI for Boxes Dots, Inspired by AlphaGo
This AI was made using Keras, TensorFlow backend, a neural network (24 -> 400 -> 24), and the minimax algorithm.

Sucessfuly beat my parents in a best of three games!!

83% accuracy emulating a minimax of depth 5.

To play (must have Keras & Tensorflow):
 - git clone git@github.com:lmunro0402/KerasAIBoxesDots.git
 - python3 Game.py
 - Follow instructions, see move_diagram.txt for how to format moves
